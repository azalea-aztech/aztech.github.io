Hey! I am Azalea. I am a hardware engineering major. I finished my degree in 2024 and have been thinking about creating this blog ever since. I am mostly going to talk about technology on this blog but there might be some outliers here and there. 
So hold tight and be sure to check in to what I have been up to once in a while. 
See you around! :)
